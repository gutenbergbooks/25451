<h3>THE</h3>
<h2>SLEEPING BEAUTY</h2>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>


<div class='cap'>ONCE upon a time there were a King and a Queen
who were very unhappy because they had no
children. Everything else that the heart could
wish for was theirs. They were rich; they lived in a
wonderful palace full of the costliest treasures; their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>kingdom was at peace, and their people were prosperous.
Yet none of these things contented them, because they
wanted a little child of their own to love and to care for,
and though they had been married several years, no child
had come to them.</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 294px;">
<img src="images/i010a.png" width="294" height="197" alt="The King and Queen" title="The King and Queen" />
</div>

<div class="figright" style="width: 237px;">
<img src="images/i010b.png" width="237" height="150" alt="Bowing to the king and queen" title="Bowing to the king and queen" />
</div><p>Every day the King would look at the Queen and say:
"Ah, if we only had a little child," and the Queen would
look at the King and sigh, and they were both very miserable
about it. Then they would put on their golden crowns<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
and sit side by side on their thrones, while lords and ladies
and ambassadors from other lands came to pay them homage,
and they had to smile with their lips for the sake of politeness,
but there was no joy in their hearts. And that is one
of the greatest disadvantages of being a King or a Queen,
that one has always to hide one's feelings.</p>





<p>Now it happened one day that the Queen went to her
bath, and having dismissed her ladies, she descended the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
marble steps into the water and began idly to play with
some wild rose-petals which had fallen into the water.
All of a sudden she heard a croaking voice that said:
"O Queen, be cheerful, for the dearest wish of your heart
will be granted you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span><br /><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

</table></div>


<p>"Who is that?" cried the Queen, a little frightened,
for she could see nobody.</p>

<p>"Look behind you," croaked the voice, "and do not be
afraid, for I come only to bear you good tidings."</p>

<p>So the Queen looked behind her, and there was a great
frog who looked at her with its big round eyes.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 380px;">
<img src="images/i014.png" width="380" height="400" alt="Frog and the queen" title="Frog and the queen" />
</div>
<p>Now the Queen was afraid of frogs, because they are
cold and clammy, but she was very polite by nature as well
as breeding, so she did not show her dislike, though she
could not help shrinking back a little.</p>

<p>"And do you tell me, Master Frog," said she, "that I
shall have the wish of my heart, and do you know what
that wish may be?"</p>

<p>"It is to have a little small child of your own," said the
Frog; and the Queen nodded.</p>

<p>"Very well," the Frog went on, "do you see the
green leaves of that almond tree on the branch by the
window?"</p>

<p>"I do," replied the Queen wonderingly.</p>

<p>"Those green leaves will fade," said the Frog, "and
the winter winds will blow them away. Then the branch
will be bare, but in spring-time, before the leaves come
again, it will be covered with pink blossom, and that
blossom you shall show to a baby lying at your breast."</p>



<p>The Queen gave a cry of joy. A ray of sunlight came
through the trees, dazzling her eyes so that she had to close<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
them for a moment. When she opened them again the
frog had gone, and nothing was to be seen but the dainty
rose-petals floating on the surface of the water.</p>

</div>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>


<div class='cap'>THOSE were wonderful tidings to be spoken by a frog
who came no one knew whence and went no one
knew whither. But the Queen believed that the
prophecy would prove true, and she was right, for when
the Spring time came again and the almond blossom was
pink upon the bough, she gave birth to a little daughter
who was so beautiful that nobody had ever seen her like.</div>

<p>Now what joy there was in the hearts of everybody in
the palace! The King was so excited that he went into
council in his dressing-gown instead of his royal robe, and
he did not care a bit when his courtiers smiled. There
was coming and going in all the halls and corridors.
Couriers on swift horses were sent out to bear the glad
news to the most distant parts of the kingdom. All the
bells in the churches were rung; flags were put out in
the houses and streamers were hung across the roadways.
Then the cannons were fired, bang, bang, bang, to tell the
people that everybody was to have a holiday, so that all,
from the highest to the lowest, might rejoice in their
Queen's happiness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>"Never was there such a beautiful child," said the
King, looking down at his little daughter as she lay in her
mother's arms. He wanted very much to nurse her, but
this could not be allowed, because men are so clumsy with
babies.</p>

<p>"What shall her name be?" said the King. And he
suggested all the grandest names he could call to mind, for
he thought that such a wonderful child must certainly have
a name to suit. But the Queen would have none of them.</p>

<p>"She shall be called Briar-Rose," said the Queen; and
so it was arranged.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i019.png" width="600" height="353" alt="Crowd" title="Crowd" />
</div>

<p>A few weeks later the christening took place. That
was a splendid ceremony to be sure, for all the lords and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
ladies of the kingdom were
present in their richest dresses,
together with princes and
ambassadors from distant
countries. The little Princess
was as good as gold all the
time. She did not cry once,
but opened her big blue eyes
and smiled at the glittering
company as though she understood
everything that was
going on.</p>

<div class='center'> <table class="tree" summary="Tree">
<tr><td align='left'>
<div class='blockquot2'>
<p>Outside the cathedral the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
roads were crowded with people waiting to see the guests
come and go. The carriages extended for nearly a mile,
and as they drove away, headed by the royal coach, in
which the Queen sat with the Princess Briar-Rose in her
arms, the spectators took off their hats and shouted and
cheered. Some of the little boys perched themselves on
the branches of trees and the lamp-posts in order to get
a better view, and I have been told that there was one
poor woman who saw nothing at all, because her boy
tried to climb up to an inn sign, where he dangled in
such a dangerous position that his poor old mother had
to stand with her back to the procession, holding on
to his legs in a terrible state of anxiety lest he should
fall.</p>

<p>At the palace, a magnificent feast had been prepared.</p>

<p>Now it was the custom in those days, when a King's
child was christened, for all the fairies in the country to be
invited to the christening feast. Each fairy was bound to
bring a gift, so of course it stood to reason that the royal
child would have everything that the heart could possibly
desire.</p></div>

<img src="images/i022.png" width="324" height="400" alt="Shut up in a ruined tower" title="Shut up in a ruined tower" />
</div>

<p>There were thirteen fairies in the King's realm, but one
of them lived in a lonely place on the outskirts of the kingdom.
There, for the last fifty years, she had shut herself
up in a ruined tower with only a black cat to keep her
company, and as she kept herself to herself, everybody had
forgotten her very existence. The result was that she was
not invited to the christening feast, and though she had
nobody but herself to blame for this, she was very angry
about it. The truth of the matter is that she was always a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
miserable, sour creature, with no love or kindness in her
heart, and nobody missed her because she had never given
anybody any reason to care for her.</p>

<p>Well, the guests assembled in the banqueting hall of the
palace and the feast began.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 197px;">

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>


<div class='cap'>THE King and the Queen sat on a dais at the end of the
banqueting hall, and above them in a little gallery
there was a band of fiddlers and flute-players. On
either side of the royal pair sat the twelve fairy godmothers,
six on the right hand and six on the left. In front
of each fairy was a golden plate and a golden casket made
to hold her knife, fork and spoon. These caskets were
beautifully carved and engraved, and each one was of a
different shape. One was in the form of a ship, another of
a shell, a third in the form of a castle with turrets, and so
on; nothing more beautiful could be imagined, for they
had all been specially made for the occasion by the
cleverest goldsmiths in the kingdom, and they were the
King's presents to the fairy godmothers. He felt very
proud when the fairies spoke admiringly of these caskets
and said that they would be pleased to accept them.</div>

<p>Below the dais were six long tables for the guests, and
there was only just room between the tables for the servants
to pass, so you may judge how crowded the room was.
Such a glittering of silks, such a flashing of jewels, such a
dazzle and splendour had never been seen since the time
of the King's coronation, and all the guests were laughing
and talking merrily. The court painter was there, of
course, to make a picture of the gorgeous scene, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
was kept so busy sketching on his tablets that he had
no time to get any food, though probably he had a good
meal afterwards.</p>

<p>And the nice things there were to eat! There were:</p>

<div class='blockquot'>
Force-meat balls flavoured with rare spices from the East;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>Sardines from Sardinia;<br />
Tunny fish from the Mediterranean and Sturgeon from Russia;<br />
Steaming boars' heads with lemons in their mouths;<br />
Turkeys, peacocks and swans;<br />
Ortolans;<br />
Wonderful roasts and delicious stews;<br />
Roe deer and Bears' hams;<br />

</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><div class="hang1">Sweets in all sorts of curious shapes, as, for instance,
cakes like castles with little men made of sweet-stuff
for sentries on the battlements, each complete
in gilded armour and with a halberd over his
shoulder. (A rare sight!) And eagles carved of
ice hovering over silver dishes filled with apricots.</div></div>

<p>Then followed the smaller dishes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">Tiny cakes as white and delicate as ladies' fingers;<br />

<div class="hang1">Birds' nests made of spun sugar (and in the nests
were eggs of marsh-mallow, and in each egg was a
tiny chicken made of caramel!);</div>
Figs and dates from the desert;<br />

Other fruits, in and out of season;<br />

Syrups and preserves fetched from the four corners of
the world;<br />

Wines cooled in snow from the distant mountains.</div>

all the delicacies.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/i027.png" width="150" height="169" alt="Page boy" title="Page boy" />
</div>

<p>Each dish was brought in by the servants in a kind of
procession, headed by the Master-Cook, looking as grand
and solemn as an archbishop, for he was a grave and
dignified person, and of course he had a great responsibility.
The guests were served by little page-boys of noble birth,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
dressed in the liveries of their masters, and these pages
handed the dishes and the wines most politely on their
bended knees as they had been taught to do.</p>

<p>So the guests enjoyed themselves, and the fiddlers played,
and the King laughed at everything everybody said, because
he was in a mighty good humour, and the bright afternoon
sun, shining through the western windows, lighted up the
rich hangings on the walls, and flashed upon the jewels on
fair ladies' fingers, and fell upon the marble pavement in a
pool of gold.</p>

<p>And then, you know, when the merriment was at its
height, something happened! There was a sudden cry,
and a harsh voice, like the croaking of a raven, sounded
through the room.</p>

<p>"Be merry, my lords and ladies," cried the voice.
"Laugh while you may, but remember that tears may
follow laughter."</p>

<p>A hush fell upon all the brilliant assembly. The Queen
turned pale and shuddered. The King rose hurriedly
from his place, and he and all the guests turned to look
at the strange figure that had suddenly appeared in the
doorway.</p>

<p>They saw an old woman bent almost double with age,
her grey head with matted hair sunk deep between her
shoulders. Her face was white and twisted with anger,
and her green eyes flashed spitefully.</p>

<p>Slowly she advanced towards the dais, and stretching
out her arm, pointed her finger at the gold plates and
the gold caskets set before the fairy godmothers. "There's
one," said she, with a harsh laugh, "there's two, there's
twelve! Did you not know, O King, that there were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
thirteen wise women in your kingdom, and the thirteenth
the wisest and most powerful of all? Where, then, is the
plate and the casket set for me?"</p>

<p>The King began to make excuses, imploring the
angry old fairy to forgive him for his neglect, and begging
her to sit down and join them in their festivities. "For,"
said he, "I am sure you are very welcome."</p>

<p>"Is it so, indeed?" said the thirteenth fairy. "I am
not too late, then, though the feast is all but done. I
shall eat off silver while my sisters eat off gold, and there
is no curiously-shaped casket for me. No matter, I am
content, because I am in time, and I shall dower the
Princess with the gift which I have brought for her!"
And here the spiteful creature uttered another of her
sneering laughs, which made the blood of all the guests
run cold.</p>

<p>By dint of much coaxing the King at last managed to
persuade her to sit down, and the feast proceeded. But a chill
had been cast over the assembly, and nothing was quite the
same as it had been before. The old crone muttered and
mouthed over her food, now and again smiling to herself
as though she were cherishing some secret and evil triumph.
The other fairies cast anxious glances at her, for they feared
her malice, and the youngest fairy of all, who happened
to be seated at the end of the table, presently rose up
quietly from her place and, stealing away, hid herself
behind the arras. And nobody saw her go, nor did a
single person remark upon her absence.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />

</div>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>


<div class='cap'>AND now came the time for the most important part
of the ceremony, when the fairy godmothers should
declare their gifts to the royal child. All this time
the little Princess Briar-Rose had been quietly sleeping in
her cradle in the nursery, watched over by an old servant
who had tended her mother as a child. Now the King
gave orders for the baby to be brought into the banqueting
hall. The guests ceased their laughter and talk, and the
musicians laid by their instruments.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></div>

<p>So the sleeping child was brought and placed in her
mother's arms. How tenderly she clasped the baby to her
breast, bending over it as though to shield it from all harm.
So sweet a sight should have touched the hardest heart,
and indeed there was only one person in the room who
remained unmoved, and that was the spiteful and jealous
fairy, who looked up and bared her yellow teeth in a
sneering grin.</p>

<p>"Queen," said she, "your face is pale and your lips
tremble. What is it that you fear on this day of the
giving of gifts?"</p>

<p>But the Queen shuddered and was silent.</p>

<p>Then a fairy rose in her place and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I will begin. My gift to the Princess Briar-Rose
is the gift of Beauty. She shall have eyes like stars, and
hair as bright as the sunshine of the spring day on which
she was born, and cheeks as fresh and fair as the petals
of the flower from which she takes her name. None
shall surpass her in loveliness."</p>

<p>Then the second fairy rose in her turn and said:
"After Beauty, Wit. The Princess shall be cleverer than
any ordinary mortal could ever hope to be."</p>

<p>"I give her Virtue," said the third. And the Queen
nodded her head and smiled, for though she esteemed
beauty and cleverness, she knew that neither was of any
worth without goodness of heart.</p>

<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="The Spiteful Fairy's Curse">

</td><td align='left'><img src="images/i034.jpg" width="303" height="385" alt="Spiteful old fairy" title="Spiteful old fairy" />
</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>So all the fairies in turn named the gift which they had
brought for Briar-Rose. The fourth said that whatever
the Princess put her hand to, she should do with the most
exquisite grace; the fifth, that she should sing like a
nightingale; the sixth that she should dance as lightly as a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
fairy, and so on until she had nearly all the virtues and
accomplishments which even a King might desire for his
daughter. But as yet, the spiteful old fairy had not said
a word.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span><br /><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span><br /><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>At last she rose and cast an evil glance round.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>"Have you all finished?" said she. "Hear, then, my
wish. On the day when she reaches her fifteenth birthday,
the Princess shall prick her finger with the spindle of a
spinning-wheel, and shall immediately die!"</p>

<p>This terrible prophecy made the whole company shudder.
The Queen gave a cry and hugged the sleeping baby still
closer to her breast.</p>

<p>"No, no! Have pity!" she cried. "Call down your
dreadful fate on my head if you will, but do not harm this
innocent child."</p>

<p>At this mournful appeal there was hardly one of the
guests who could keep from tears, but the old crone only
mumbled to herself as though she were uttering a spell.
Then the King leapt to his feet, his hand at the jewelled
hilt of the dagger that hung at his girdle. In another
moment he might have stretched the wicked creature
lifeless at his feet, but before he could draw the weapon
from its sheath, another voice arrested him.</p>

<p>"Stay your hand, O King, lest even worse befall. No
mortal may strike at a fairy and go unpunished. And,
for the rest, take comfort, for your daughter shall not
die!"</p>

<p>Then the twelfth fairy stepped out from behind the
arras where she had been hidden. "My gift is still to
come," she continued. "As far as I can, I will undo the
mischief which my sister has done. It is true that I have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
not the power to prevent altogether what she has decreed.
The Princess shall, indeed, prick her finger with the
spindle of the spinning-wheel on the day when she attains
her fifteenth year; but instead of dying she shall fall into a
deep sleep; and this sleep shall last for a hundred years, and
when that time is past, a King's son shall come to waken
her."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>


<div class='cap'>SO the worst was averted, but the fate of the poor little
Princess was still terrible enough, and it was only
to be expected that the King should do his best to
prevent the prophecy from coming to fulfilment.</div>

<p>The first thing he did was to summon all the magicians
of his own and neighbouring countries, promising a rich
reward to the one who could show him a way to defeat the
old fairy's malice. The magicians came in scores, some
with long beards reaching to their feet, some without any
beards at all, some with bald heads, and some with matted
hair that looked as though it had not been combed for
centuries. For days there were so many magicians about
the palace that they were commoner than cats, and it was
impossible to enter any room without surprising one or the
other of them, sitting in deep reflection and looking as wise
as only a magician can look. But nothing came of their
thinking, and one after the other they gave up the task and
departed, having first asked for their travelling expenses.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 180px;">
<img src="images/i039.png" width="180" height="300" alt="Merlin" title="Merlin" />
</div>

<p>At last there came a wizard who was wiser and more
venerable than all the rest, and when he heard what was
required of him he said he would go home and consult his
secret books which contained the magic lore of all the ages,
and which had been written by the greatest of all the
magicians, Merlin himself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>Home, then, he went, to his cell, which was in a rocky
cliff on the side of a mountain, and having uttered the word
of power which unlocked the massive door, he entered and
prepared to begin his researches.</p>


<p>Now the books of magic lore which Merlin had written
were in many volumes, and everything in them was set
down in alphabetical order, so that it could be found easily.
The old wizard, therefore, turned first of all to the word
<i>Princess</i>. Five hundred pages were devoted to this subject,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
and, truly, there was a great deal of very interesting
information. As thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class='hang1'><span class="smcap">Princess:</span> How to transform Goosegirl into.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Spell for causing Princess to be surrounded with
high walls of bronze, which may by no means be
broken down except by the notes of a certain
trumpet (<i>q.v.</i>).</p></div>

<p>(Now <i>q.v.</i> are the first letters of two magic words
which are to be found in all dictionaries and encyclop&aelig;dias
to this day).</p>

<div class='hang1'><span class="smcap">Princess:</span> Enchanted ring for.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A new and improved method by which she may
be changed into a fawn together with any members
of her family according to desire, and all of them
transformed back again into their proper shape.</p></div>

<div class='hang1'><span class="smcap">Princess:</span> An excellent device for causing a Princess to
grow tall or short by eating of a mushroom, with
directions how to find the place where the mushroom
grows, and precautions to be taken lest by over-much
nibbling she disappear altogether.</div>

<p>And so on. But there was never a word about how to
prevent a Princess from falling into a charmed sleep through
pricking her finger with the spindle of a spinning-wheel.</p>

<p>So when he had read all through the five hundred pages,
the venerable wizard turned to the word <i>Sleep</i>, in the hope
that he would meet with better fortune.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 325px;">
<img src="images/i042.png" width="325" height="400" alt="In mysterious places" title="In mysterious places" />
</div>

<p>And there was much reliable information under this
heading also. There were recipes for potent drugs which
would cause sleep, and for still more potent drugs which
would prevent people from going to sleep, and when the
wizard came to this last he cried out eagerly, for he thought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
that he had succeeded in his quest, until he read on and
discovered that the spell described was only for use on
wicked Queens who had shamefully ill-used their step-children.
It is very easy to make a mistake in magic, for
it is a most complicated science.</p>

<p>By the time he had read through the two hundred pages
devoted to the word <i>Sleep</i>, the venerable wizard was very
uneasy, but he was a persevering person and he did not
abandon his endeavours. Merlin's wise books having failed
him, he cast about for other means to learn what he desired,
and consulted his oracle.</p>

<p>Now his oracle was a stuffed crocodile hanging from
the ceiling, and a voice came from it which told him to repeat
the magic formula.</p>

<p>The magic formula is a sentence made up of all the
sounds that are left out of ordinary speech, and it is a fearsome
thing to listen to. It is also very exhausting to say,
and after the venerable wizard had repeated it, he was
obliged to rest for several hours. Then he rose again and
drew pentagons on the rocky floor of his cave, and crossed
triangles and circles bordered with all the signs of the
Zodiac. And he stood in the middle of the pentagons
and the crossed triangles and the circles and went
through all sorts of strange and secret rites, but all to no
purpose.</p>


<p>But still he would not give up trying; and he went to
mysterious places in the woods and gathered strange herbs
in the dark of the moon. And, returning home, he cast
the herbs into a brazier and they burnt with flames of
many colours, giving out clouds of dense smoke and a most
horrible smell. Then, as these exercises did not bring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
him the result he desired, he gazed into crystals and poured
ink into the palm of his hand, and did all the other things
that he had learnt to do in all the years since he was
apprenticed to magic as a very small boy.</p>

<p>And just as he was going to give up the quest in
despair, a thought came into his head, and he cried aloud
for joy, for he knew he had discovered what he sought.
This shows how even the most difficult things may be
attained by perseverance and patience.</p>

<p>At the top of his speed he hastened back to the palace
and asked an audience of the King. This was immediately
granted, for, to tell the truth, the King was awaiting
his return with considerable anxiety.</p>

<p>"Well," said he, "have you succeeded in finding a
way?"</p>

<p>"I have," answered the venerable wizard. "My arts
have not failed me!" And he handed the King a piece
of parchment on which were written the following words.
They were written in Latin to make them look more
important, but very likely it was not good Latin, for the
venerable wizard had been apprenticed to his trade at an
early age, and in consequence his classical education had
been somewhat neglected. But this was the meaning of
them:</p>

<div class='poem'>
Shall spindle prick?&mdash;then spindle burn,<br />
No thread weave and no wheel turn;<br />
If there's no spindle and there's no wheel,<br />
Then no finger the spindle can feel.<br /></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>The King slapped his thigh for joy. "Why, of course!"
said he. "How is it that I did not myself think of such
a simple solution? It seems to me, Wizard, that you have
easily earned your thousand crowns!"</p>

<p>"Ah, Majesty," the wizard made answer, "all things
are simple when once you know them."</p>

<p>And in this he was quite right.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>


<div class='cap'>THE King lost no time in putting the wizard's counsel
into effect. The very next day he caused a proclamation
to be written, and ordered copies of it
to be fixed on all the church doors, and in all the public
places of every town in his kingdom. This is the way
the proclamation read:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></div>


<div class='center'> <table class="proclaim" summary="proclamation">
<tr><td align='left'><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

WHEREAS a certain malicious fairy, forgetful of the
duties she owes to the most high and puissant King

to the Princess Briar-Rose, their dearly loved daughter,
has, of malice aforethought, and with intent to work
grievous bodily harm to the person of the said Princess,
in the presence of the said most puissant Sovereigns
and of divers of their loyal subjects made and uttered
a prophecy, to wit: that the said Princess shall in her
fifteenth year prick her finger with the spindle of a
spinning-wheel, and that a certain dire misfortune
shall fall upon her because of that injury, to the sorrow

together with all spindles, shuttles, bobbins, and all

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>The issue of this proclamation caused a great deal of
interest and excitement throughout the kingdom. All the
people came out of their houses to gaze at it, for they had
never seen its like before, and though very few of them
knew how to read they realised that it must mean something
very important. So they sent for clerks and scholars
to read it to them, paying a penny apiece for the service,
which pennies, the clerks and scholars, being usually extraordinarily
needy persons, were very glad to earn. It
usually took about three hours to read the proclamation
and to explain it; and one must admit that it might have
been expressed in fewer words. To do so, however, would
not have been dignified, for this proclamation was what is
called a legal instrument.</p>

<p>The very next day into each town and village of the
kingdom the King's officers came riding. Before them
went a trumpeter who stopped at the head of each street
and blew a loud call. Having thus commanded attention
he marched past the houses calling in a loud voice:</p>

<p>"Bring out your spinning-wheels. Bring out your
spinning-wheels!"</p>

<p>So the people brought them out, not without grumbling,
for a spinning-wheel is a very useful thing to have in a
house, and in those days people spun and wove their own
cloth to make their clothes. But they were afraid to disobey
the King's order.</p>

<p>And the spinning-wheels were of all shapes and sizes, some
of them new and some of them hundreds of years old, and
there was hardly a house that did not possess one of some
kind or another. They were all collected together and
loaded into waggons and taken to the capital, where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
they were piled up into an immense heap in the public
square.</p>

<p>Then the King and Queen and all the court came out
and watched while the big heap was set on fire. The
people came out to watch too in their thousands, and a
very fine sight it was to see the enormous flames shooting
up into the air and to hear the crackle and hiss of the
burning wood that sounded like the discharge of a hundred
muskets.</p>

<p>The King laughed aloud in his relief, and even the
Queen smiled, while the little Princess Briar-Rose, who was
held up to a window of the palace to see the bonfire,
stretched out her arms to the pretty flames and crowed.
But the people were not very much amused by the sight
because they were their spinning-wheels which were being
burnt.</p>

<p>"I've had my wheel for twenty years," said one woman,
"and now I've none at all, and how on earth I can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
get along without it I don't know, with six growing lads

<p>"Five silver crowns my wheel cost my good man last
Candlemass," said another, "and there it goes up in flames
and smoke."</p>

<p>"What is a wheel if the burning of it saves our little
Princess?" quoth a third. "Come, cheer up, Mother, the
King has reason for what he does and he will not see us
want."</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 431px;">
<img src="images/i051.png" width="431" height="400" alt="Bonfire" title="Bonfire" />
</div>
<p>And this man was right. The King had no wish to
oppress his subjects, for no sooner was the pile reduced to
ashes than he caused another proclamation to be issued,
saying that the owner of every spinning-wheel should be
paid for its loss. And not only so, but the King told his
merchants to buy spun yarn from neighbouring countries
so that the people might be able to weave, even though
they could not spin.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>


<div class='cap'>THE little Princess Briar-Rose, of course, knew
nothing of the strange events that had happened
at the feast of her christening, and the King
gave orders that nobody should even mention the subject
to her. It is not a pleasant thing to know that the
fairies have decreed that one shall fall asleep for a
hundred years on one's fifteenth birthday, even though
one is to be awakened by a handsome Prince at the end
of that time. So all the lords-in-waiting and the ladies-in-waiting
had to be very careful and discreet. If they
told the Princess a story, they had to keep the word
"spinning" out of it; and if they showed her a book they
had to take pains to see it did not contain a picture of a
spinning-wheel, or any reference to a distaff or spindle, lest
she should ask what they were. The King's Customs
officers, on the boundaries of the kingdom, had to examine
every waggon-load of merchandise that came into the
country for fear it should contain a spinning-wheel; and
if anybody was found trying to smuggle one in he was
brought before the judges and punished.</div>

<p>By these devices the King felt certain that he had
averted the fate laid upon his daughter.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 131px;">
<img src="images/i054.png" width="131" height="200" alt="Princess playing a drum" title="Princess playing a drum" />
</div>
<p>But the promises of the other wise women were fulfilled
to the letter, for the young Princess grew up to be the
most beautiful, gifted and gracious maiden in all the world.
That, at any rate, was what everybody in the palace said,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
from the lords and ladies down to the scullions in the
kitchen, and although people are inclined sometimes to
flatter Royalty, in this case there was reason for their
admiration.</p>

<p>To begin with, the Princess was as lovely as a spring
morning, with eyes of the purest, softest blue, and hair in
which the rays of the sun seemed to be entangled. When
she came into a room people stopped whatever they were
doing to look at her, and everyone felt happier because she
was there.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<img src="images/i055.png" width="260" height="250" alt="Drawing on a wall" title="Drawing on a wall" />
</div>

<p>And her cleverness! She never had any trouble with
her letters or her multiplication table. She could cipher
as easily as she could spell; she knew the history of her
own country and of every country round it; and nobody
could puzzle her with the hardest question in geography.
She could sew and embroider, and knit and paint and draw;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
she could repeat poetry in five different languages;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
she studied mathematics and botany and astronomy and
even law. In short, there was no end to her knowledge,
and all because she had those fairies for her godmothers.</p>

<img src="images/i056.png" width="400" height="385" alt="Princess everywhere" title="Princess everywhere" />
</div>


<p>Besides this, there were all her other accomplishments; she
could play on all sorts of musical instruments, as, for instance,
fiddle and zither, large harp and jew's-harp, church organ and
mouth organ, flute and penny-whistle, and even on the
nursery comb; she could sing like a nightingale and dance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
like a fairy.</p>

<p>And yet she was never conceited or puffed-up, as some
good-looking and accomplished people are apt to be. On
the contrary, she was always sweet-tempered and modest,
and for this reason she was loved. People may admire<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
good looks and a graceful deportment, and they may
respect ability, but it is only sweetness of nature and
goodness of heart that can win love. And these things
were the gift of the third fairy.</p>

<p>So the years passed, and at last came the day when the
Princess Briar-Rose was fifteen years of age.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i061.png" width="300" height="318" alt="Princess playing music" title="Princess playing music" />
</div>

<p>What a day that was! Everybody came to wish her
many happy returns, and she had so many presents that
at least a dozen servants were kept busy unwrapping the
parcels. The King gave her a white pony with a saddle
of red velvet, and bridle and stirrups of gold, while the
Queen's present was a beautiful and costly necklace of
pearls. Even the boy who turned the spit in the kitchen
brought her something, and though it was only a little
wooden shoe which he had carved with his own hands, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
Princess prized it just as much as though it had been made
of gold.</p>

<p>The only person who was not happy on the Princess's
birthday was the Queen, and she went about with a pale
face and a look of great anxiety.</p>

<p>"Come, come, my love," said the King, "what is the
matter with you? Surely you are not thinking of that
foolish old prophecy!"</p>

<p>"How can I help thinking about it?" the Queen
answered. "I have not been able to get it out of my
mind for fifteen years, and now that the day has come I
am afraid."</p>

<div class='blockquot2'><p>"Make your mind easy," said the King. "Nothing
is going to happen. Why, there's not a spinning-wheel
within a hundred miles. I have taken good care
of that!" And he went away chuckling, to attend
a meeting of his Cabinet. But the Queen shook her
head.</p>

<p>Now while the King and Queen were talking, the
Princess Briar-Rose was wandering about in the castle,
visiting room after room, as she had done many times
before. The castle was so big that a stranger might easily
have been lost in its maze of stairways and corridors, but
Briar-Rose knew every part of it quite well, from the great
kitchens below ground, where on feast days a score of cooks
prepared the dinner for hundreds of guests, to the topmost
turret above the battlements, where the sentries kept watch
with their pikes on their shoulders. There was only one
part of the castle which Briar-Rose had never explored,
and that was an ancient tower which rose from the eastern
end. The door of that tower was always locked, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
although the Princess had often
tried to find the key she had
never succeeded. The servants
told her that the tower had not
been inhabited for nearly a hundred
years, and it had never been
entered within the memory of
anybody in the castle.</p></div>
<br /></td>
</tr></table></div>





<p>To-day Briar-Rose flitted restlessly
from place to place. She
peeped into the kitchen and saw
the kitchen boys turning the spits
on which whole oxen were being
roasted. Then she went into
the empty throne room and saw
the golden thrones side by side
upon the dais, and the rich
tapestry, glowing with all the
colours of the rainbow, on the
walls. After that she mounted
to the battlements from which
she could see over miles and miles
of her father's kingdom, and not
content with that, she ran up the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
staircases into the turrets and looked through their narrow
slits of windows upon the courtyard below, so far down
that the people walking therein seemed no bigger than
mice. And then she came down again and continued her
wanderings, searching in all sorts of out-of-the-way corners,
until at last she found herself before the door of the
ancient tower into which she had never been. And as she
looked at the door, she gave a start of surprise and then
a cry of joy.</p>

<p>There was a key in the lock.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

</div>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>


<div class='cap'>IT was a rusty key, and Briar-Rose was afraid that she
might not be able to turn it, but to her surprise it
turned quite easily. The heavy door swung inward
on its ancient hinges with many a creak and groan, and
she found herself in a little dark room thickly carpeted
with the dust of years. From this room a winding staircase
led upward, and Briar-Rose was just about to climb the
stair when a sudden noise made her start back in alarm.</div>

<div class="figright" style="width: 315px;">
<img src="images/i068.png" width="315" height="400" alt="Princess opening the door" title="Princess opening the door" />
</div>

<p><i>Whirr!</i> There was a beating of wings, a flurry and a
scuffle, and past her face flew a dark shape, with gleaming,
yellow eyes. It was only an owl who was hiding in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
tower out of the sunlight, but he gave poor Briar-Rose a
great fright, and she was in two minds whether to turn
back or not, but the winding staircase looked very inviting
and she wanted to see whither it led, so gathering up her
skirts to avoid any creepy things that might be crawling
about, she ran up the stairway as fast as she could, round
and round until she reached the top. There she came
upon another door.</p>

<p>In this door also was a rusty key, and Briar-Rose turned
it as easily as she had turned the first. Then she pushed
open the door and entered.</p>

<p>She found herself in a small room lighted by narrow
windows. Beneath one of these windows was a couch,
and in front of it sat an old woman with a spinning-wheel.</p>

<p>"Good-morrow, Motherkin," said the Princess. "What
are you doing?"</p>

<p>"I am spinning, my pretty child," answered the old
woman without ceasing her work.</p>

<p>"Spinning?" asked the Princess. "Oh, do let me see!
What is that thing which goes round so merrily?"</p>

<p>"That is the spinning-wheel," said the old woman.
"Why, child, you speak as though you had never seen such
a thing before."</p>

<p>"Indeed, I have not," said the Princess. "How interesting
it is! I wonder whether I could do it as well as you.
Will you let me try?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course," said the old woman, "every young
girl should know how to spin. Here you are, my dear,"
and she gave Briar-Rose the spindle.</p>

<p>Now whether the Princess in her eagerness to seize the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
spindle grasped it too roughly, or whether it was just because
the fairy had ordained that it should be so, I do not know,
but anyhow the sharp iron point pricked her hand, and
immediately she fell backward on to the couch in a deep
sleep.</p>

<p>And in that very moment sleep fell upon every man,
woman and child in the castle, and upon every living thing
within its gates. The King, who was sitting at the
Council-board with his ministers, stopped speaking in the
middle of a sentence, and remained with his mouth open,
in the act of uttering a word, and nobody remarked the
strangeness of his conduct, for all his ministers were asleep
too, just as they sat. Outside the door the sentry leaned
upon his pike. In the Queen's chamber the ladies-in-waiting
fell into a profound slumber in the very midst
of what they were doing&mdash;one as she was hemming a
handkerchief, another over her embroidery, still another
while she was talking to her parrot. The Queen slept in
her chair, and a little page-boy who was singing fell asleep
in the middle of a note.</p>

<p>All through the castle the charmed slumber spread.
Courtiers, officers, stewards, cooks, errand-boys, soldiers,
beadles,&mdash;nay the very horses in the stables and the dogs in
their kennels were stricken motionless as though they were
dead. The flies ceased to buzz at the windows and the
pigeons to coo upon the roof. In the great kitchen the
scullions fell asleep as they were washing up the dishes,
and a cook in the very act of boxing the ears of a
kitchen-knave.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i071.png" width="200" height="78" alt="Dog asleep" title="Dog asleep" />
</div>

<p>But not for a hundred years would he feel that blow,
or be able to utter the cry that was on the tip of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
tongue. The dog fell asleep under the table as he was
gnawing a bone; the cat in front of a mouse-hole, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
mouse itself on the other side of the skirting-board, with
its little sharp nose outstretched to sniff the air suspiciously.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Even the spits which were turning at the fire, laden with
partridges and pheasants cooking for the Princess's birthday
feast&mdash;even they ceased to turn, and the very fire stopped
flickering and the flames sank down.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i072.png" width="350" height="170" alt="Cat sleeping with mouse" title="Cat sleeping with mouse" />
</div>

<p>A deep silence fell over the castle. In the fields the
lambs ceased to bleat, the horses to neigh and the cows to
low. The birds in the trees were silent. One moment
the air was full of the music of their twittering; the next,
all was as still as in a desert. The very wind dropped to
sleep in the woods; not a leaf stirred, and the white clouds
were motionless in the sky.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>So sleep fell upon the enchanted castle and upon all
within it, because of the Princess Briar-Rose, who lay
there on her couch in the ancient tower waiting till
the hundred years should be past and the Prince should
come to waken her.</p>

<p>And all round the castle there grew up a hedge of
thorn, tangled with ivy, woodbine and creeping plants, so
dense that from a distance it seemed like a little wood.
Higher and higher it grew, closing round the castle like a
wall until all that could be seen was the top of the highest
tower, and the flagstaff from which the royal standard
hung limp and motionless.</p>

<div class='center'> <table class="thorn" summary="Thornbush">

<div class='blockquot4'><p>And the years went by, each with its changing seasons.
Spring came and brought to the fields and woods outside
the new life of leaf and flower. The trees awoke from
their winter sleep and clothed themselves gloriously in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
green; the birds began to sing
again and the swallows and martins
built their nests under the eaves;
children laughed and clapped their
hands because they were happy in
the bright sunshine, and old people
felt their hearts filled with joy
when they saw the mist of
bluebells in the woods and
the daffodils dancing in
the breeze.</p>



<p>But within the thorn
hedge no life stirred, and
neither flower nor tree
answered the call of spring.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p></div>

<p>As time went on, the people who were young when
the palace was enchanted grew old and died, but they
never forgot the prophecy that one of these days the
sleeping Princess should awaken; and they told the story
to their children, who told it in their turn, changing it a
little because it was only a tale to them. And so, after
many years, the legend spread abroad to neighbouring
countries, and many a young prince dreamed that it was he
who was destined to break the spell and waken the sleeping
Princess.</p>

<p>Now and again one would take the quest upon him
and try to force his way through the thick hedge. But no
one succeeded. The sharp thorns gripped the unhappy
young men like clutching hands, and held them fast, so that
they could neither go forward nor back, and they perished
miserably. Their bones, whitened by the sun and wind,
remained there as a warning for all to see, and the
creeping plants grew over them.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>


<div class='cap'>A &nbsp;&nbsp;HUNDRED years passed away. At the end of that
time it happened one day that a young Prince who
was hunting in the neighbourhood caught sight of
the towers of the enchanted castle rising above the dense
forest. He had never been in that part of the country
before, and had heard nothing of the story of the Sleeping
Princess, so he asked the first people he met what those
towers were, and to whom the castle belonged.</div>

<p>Everybody told him a different tale. One said that it
was an old castle haunted by spirits; another, that it was a
meeting-place for all the witches and sorcerers in the land,
who gathered there to practise their secret rites.</p>

<p>"No, no," said a third. "That castle is the home of a
giant, and all the people in these parts are very much afraid
of him, so I have been told, because he steals their cattle
and their crops, and even carries off their children to be his
servants. And they cannot go to the rescue of those he
has imprisoned in this way, because of the forest all round
the castle, which is so dense that nobody can force his way
through.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>"</p>

<p>And so they went on, one saying one thing, and one
another, for each repeated what he had heard. At last an
old peasant stepped forward.</p>

<p>"Fifty years ago, my Prince," said he, "my father told
me the story of that castle, and since he was born in these
parts, I think it was the true story, and I will tell it you if
you would like to hear it."</p>

<p>The Prince nodded eagerly, and the old man went
on:</p>

<p>"My father said that years before he himself was born
a King and Queen lived in the castle with their daughter,
the most beautiful Princess that ever was seen. In some
way or other they angered the fairies, who put a spell upon
the place and upon every one within it, so that they fell
into a deep sleep. My father said that this sleep would last
a hundred years, but at the end of that time a King's son
should come and waken the beautiful Princess and make
her his bride."</p>

<p>When the young Prince heard these words he felt his
heart beat quickly. Something seemed to tell him that he
and no other was the King's son who was destined to
remove the spell, and he cried: "Show me the way to the
castle, for I will take this adventure upon me."</p>

<div class='center'>

</table></div>
<p>But the old man shook his head. "I have not yet told
you all, my Prince. Many are the young men who have
tried to force their way through the thick wood that
guards the enchanted castle. Each of them thought that
he, and he alone, was destined to awaken the Sleeping
Beauty, and each of them set out with high hopes; but
none of them all came back, and their bones, whitened
by the wind and rain, lie among the thorns of the thick<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
hedge, a fearful warning to the venturesome. I pray you,
therefore, my Prince, do nothing rash, but think well
before you take upon yourself this perilous quest."</p>



<p>"What," cried the Prince with flashing eyes, "shall I
hold back when others have dared? This very hour I will
attempt to enter the castle, and if I do not return, carry
home the news of how I have died."</p>

<p>Then without paying any heed to the words of those
who would prevent him from rushing into such danger,
the eager young man set out, his heart on fire with
thoughts of love and glory. Nobody showed him the
way, but he could see the towers of the castle rising above
the distant wood, and when he entered the wood itself,
and the towers were hidden, each path he took led him
nearer to the place where he would be.</p>

<p>At last he came to an open glade, and there before him
was a tangled hedge of thorn, stretching in either direction
as far as the eye could see.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>


<div class='cap'>AND now, as the Prince drew nearer, he could see
that the story he had heard about that terrible
place was true, for held in the tangle of briar were
the bones of many unhappy young men who had tried to
force their way through to the castle. Rags and tatters of
their finery hung upon the great thorns that pointed
menacingly like sharp claws. Here and there upon the
ground beneath lay pieces of rusty armour, a helmet
surrounded by a coronet of gold that once had belonged to
a King's son, a shield with a Prince's device, a sword with
jewel-encrusted hilt worth a King's ransom. There they
lay, all disregarded among the blanched bones upon the
grass, and the ground-ivy spread out its leaves to cover
them.</div>

<p>Not a sound broke the deep and awful silence. No
bird sang, no insect droned; there was no scurry of woodland
creatures among the leaves, no sigh of wind in the
trees. In all that place only the thorn hedge seemed
threateningly alive, waiting to destroy the intruder who
should attempt to force the secret it guarded.</p>

<p>Who would blame the Prince if for a moment his heart
had almost failed him? There was no gap in that hedge,
and the great thorns were sharp as dagger blades to stab
his flesh. But if the Prince hesitated it was not for long.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
"Have I come so far to turn back now?" he thought.
"These others who have died were brave men, and though
they failed, with a courage as great as theirs I may succeed."
And without wasting another moment the Prince began to
force his way through the hedge.</p>

<p>And now he noticed with surprise that those thorns
which looked so sharp and cruel became soft as thistledown
as soon as he touched them, and the trailing bramble
branches did not entangle him but bent aside at his touch
as though they had been stems of grass. The hedge opened
before him, and as he went through it pink blossoms of
wild roses bloomed on the branches, until the tangled wall
became a mass of flowers.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 329px;">
<img src="images/i088.png" width="329" height="400" alt="Everything just as it was" title="Everything just as it was" />
</div>

<p>At last the Prince found himself on the other side of the
hedge in the gardens of the castle. Before him he could
see the high towers and turrets bathed in the fresh light of
the morning sun, and as he hastened towards them he
noticed that the gardens were as trim and tidy as though
they had just been tended by the gardeners. There was no
moss or weed upon the smooth paths, the turf on the lawns
was as short and firm as though it had just been mown,
and in the flower-beds everything was in the most careful
order. Spring flowers were blooming there, but they bowed
their heads upon their stalks, and even the trees seemed to
hang their arms as though asleep.</p>

<p>Everywhere there was the same deep silence. The air,
which should have been full of the twittering of birds,
was heavy and languorous. There was no flutter of butterfly-wings
or darting of flies; the fountains on the lawns
were not playing, and as the Prince glanced over the edge<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
of the marble basin of one of them he could see the goldfish
beneath the water-lily leaves lying still, with never a wave
of the tail or flicker of fin.</p>



<p>So he went on over the lawns and terraces and never
a waking thing did he see, but when he came to the courtyard
he saw a soldier standing there, leaning on his pike
with his head bent upon his chest. At first the Prince<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
thought that he was dead, but his cheek was fresh and
ruddy and it was quite plain to see that he was merely
asleep. In the courtyard itself were other human forms,
all still and silent. A row of pikemen leaned against the
wall and in front of them, stretched out upon the ground,
snored the sergeant who had been drilling them when the
spell came upon the castle. A young squire, with a sleeping<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
hawk upon his wrist, slept leaning against a sleeping horse
which he had been about to mount. Near by lay a page
with a hound in leash, both sleeping as soundly as though
they never would awake, and through a window in the
stables the Prince saw a groom lying with a straw in his
mouth.</p>


<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="Everyone asleep">
<tr><td align='left'><img src="images/i089.png" width="224" height="250" alt="One man asleep" title="One man asleep" />
</td><td align='left'><img src="images/i090.png" width="380" height="250" alt="Many soldiers asleep" title="Many soldiers asleep" />
</td></tr>
</table></div>


<p>In the stables themselves a like condition of things
prevailed. The horses slept at their stalls with their noses
to the mangers, standing on their four legs just as they were
when they were enchanted a hundred years before, and on
the back of one of them sat the stable-cat. Here and there
upon the ground lay grooms and ostlers, fast asleep among
the straw.</p>

<p>From the stables the Prince made his way to the great
kitchen where he saw equally strange sights, and he could
not help smiling when he came upon the cook with her
hand still outstretched to clout the head of the unhappy
scullion whom she had by the ear. Before the fires hung
the spitted partridges and fowls that were cooking for the
Princess's birthday feast, and at the table a maid had fallen
asleep with her hands in a large trough full of dough.
She had been making the pastry for a pie when the sleep
fell upon her, and by her side was another maid who
had been plucking a black hen. At the sink a kitchen-knave
was leaning over the pot he had been scouring.</p>

<p>Then the Prince went out into the great hall and saw
the courtiers asleep in the window alcoves, or stretched
out upon the polished floor. Everywhere was a silence so
profound that the Prince was almost alarmed to hear his
own breathing, and the beating of his heart sounded like a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
muffled drum. On and on he went, through rooms and
corridors, up staircases and down staircases, into the Queen's
chamber where he saw the Queen and her ladies as still
and silent as the rest; one of those ladies had been reading
to the Queen at the moment when the charmed sleep fell
upon the castle, and the book, a History of Troy, still lay
open on her lap. Then the Prince went into the King's
room where his Majesty sat with his ministers of state round
the Council board. He almost lingered there, for it was
very curious to see those nobles as quiet and motionless as
though they had been waxworks in a show. Some of
them were frowning as though in deep thought, and some
smiling as though they had suddenly remembered something
clever to say. The King himself, at the head of the
Council table, had evidently fallen asleep in the very midst
of a speech, for his arm lay outstretched on the table with
pointing finger, and, by his side, his secretary's fingers still
held the pen with which he was inscribing on a roll of
parchment the royal words.</p>

<p>So the Prince hurried through the castle from top to
bottom until he had glanced into every room and opened
every door. And still he knew that there was something
more to see, for nowhere had he come across the sleeping
Princess. Many maidens he had seen of surpassing beauty,
but his heart told him that none of them all was the maiden
whom he had come to awaken.</p>

<p>Down he went into the courtyard again and found
another stairway which led to the battlements. There
stood the watchmen whose duty it was to look out over
the country and report the arrival of travellers, but they,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
too, were all asleep, though one of them had his horn in
his hand as though he had been about to blow it when he
was suddenly overcome by the charmed slumber.</p>

<p>From the battlements the Prince climbed, in turn, into
each of the turrets, but there was nobody in them at all,
and no living thing except the owls asleep in the
crevices of the walls, and the bats that hung head downward
from the rafters. Now only one small turret remained
to be explored. It was the oldest of the turrets,
almost a ruin, and plainly long unused, for the iron door
was rusty and the ivy trailed about the walls.</p>

</div>
<p>The Prince approached it with a beating heart, for there
he knew he should find what he sought. He threw open
the creaking door; with impatient feet he mounted the
crazy, winding stair, opened the door at the top and
entered a little dark room.</p>

<p>And then&mdash;and then he started forward with a cry of
joy and wonder, for lying on the couch below the narrow
window he saw the Princess.</p>

<p>She was lying upon a couch with her lovely hair spread
out like a stream of gold; and, oh! no words can tell how
beautiful she was. Softly the Prince came near and bent
over her. He touched her hand; it was warm as in life,
but she did not stir. No sound of breathing came from
her parted lips, fresh and sweet as the petals of a rose;
her eyes were closed.</p>

<p>For a long time the Prince stood and gazed upon her,
for never in all his life had he seen a maiden so lovely.
Then suddenly he bent down and kissed her lips.</p>



<p>That was the end of the enchantment. The Princess's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
eyelids quivered; languidly she moved her head and
stretched out her arms. Her eyes opened and she
smiled.</p>

<p>"Is it you, my Prince?" she said. "How long you
have kept me waiting!"</p>

<div class='cap'>IN that very moment the charm was broken and the
castle awoke.</div>


<p>Instead of the profound silence there came a hustle
and confusion of noise. Clocks began to strike, doors began
to slam, dogs began to bark, cocks began to crow and hens
to cluck; a breeze sprang up outside and set the branches
of the trees swaying and creaking; the doves began to coo
upon the roofs, the swallows to twitter under the eaves, flies
came out and buzzed about the window, mice squeaked in
the wainscot and ran scampering along the rafters. The
fountain in the garden leapt up sixty feet into the air, and
the goldfish swam among the water-lily leaves; ants left
their nests and foraged about the paths, the butterflies
danced and fluttered over the flowers, which lifted their
heads as though to drink in the rays of the sun. In every
tree in the garden a thrush woke up and began to sing;
sparrows chirped, jays screamed, blue-tits chattered, and the
chiff-chaff uttered his strange note. In the woods a cuckoo
called and blackbird fluted to blackbird in the hedge. In
the stables the horses awoke and champed at their stalls;
the cat jumped down and ran after a mouse which crept out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
from under the straw. The sentry at the courtyard gate
woke up and rubbed his eyes and came smartly to attention,
looking round uneasily, for he thought he had only been
asleep for a few minutes and was afraid that somebody<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
might have seen him who would report him to the sergeant.
The pikemen also woke with a start, and the sergeant woke
too, and bellowed an order in a loud and angry voice, for he
was ashamed of himself for sleeping in front of his men.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
The young squire who was going hawking fitted his falcon's
hood and mounted his steed; the page-boy with the hound
went off to his master. On the topmost tower of the castle
the royal standard, which had been drooping against the
flagstaff, filled out and waved freely in the breeze.</p>

<p>The hedge which had grown up to surround the enchanted
castle broke in and disappeared; peacocks squalled
and strutted on the lawns, martins flitted to and from their
nests under the eaves, pigs began to grunt, oxen to low,
sheep to bleat, rooks to caw and children to laugh and sing.
In short, all the sounds which we hear every day and all the
time and never notice, began again and seemed so loud in
contrast to the deadly silence that they almost cracked
the ears.</p>

<p>And in every room in the castle the people who had
been lying asleep for a hundred years woke up and went
on with what they had been doing just as though nothing
had happened. In the kitchen the flames of the fire leapt
up with a hiss and a roar. The kettle began to boil, the
stew-pot to bubble, and the meat before the fire to steam
and hiss as the little boy turned the spit.</p>

<p>"Take that," cried the cook, giving the scullion the
clout she had promised a hundred years before. "Take
that for a lazy knave."</p>

<p>"Goodness," yawned the maid who had been plucking
the black hen; "I wonder what made me drop off to sleep
like that? Well, well, it's to be hoped the cook didn't see
me!" And my word, how she made the feathers fly!</p>

<p><i>Miaou!</i> cried the cat in disgust as he made a pounce at
the mouse-hole he had been watching, for the little mouse<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
who had poked his nose out a hundred years before drew it
back like a flash and scampered away.</p>

<img src="images/i105.png" width="110" height="200" alt="Flies above the milk pan" title="Flies above the milk pan" />
</div>
<p>"Dear me!" said the servant who was washing the
dishes; "I do believe I have been to sleep with this crock
in my hand. It's a mercy I didn't let it fall!" And he
went on with his scouring. It was the same thing in the
dairy where the maids had fallen asleep while they were
skimming the cream and churning the butter. And the
cream was not sour for all that a hundred years had passed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
nor was the butter rank. But a fly which had been sleeping
on the edge of one of the milk-pans woke up and flew down
to taste the milk, and fell in and was drowned, so he was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
none the better because the spell had been taken off the
castle.</p>



<p>In the Queen's ante-chamber the maids-of-honour and
the ladies-in-waiting sat up and yawned and stretched themselves.
Each one of them thought that she was the only
one who had fallen asleep, and they all began to explain at
the same time that they had only closed their eyes for forty
seconds. "It was the heat," they all said to each other.
"The sun is very hot for this time of year."</p>

<p>In the King's council chamber the King and all his
ministers woke up with a start. The ministers rubbed their
eyes and looked very sheepish, for each of them thought
that he was alone in being caught napping.</p>

<p>"Your Majesty was saying...?" said the Prime
Minister respectfully, leaning forward.</p>

<p>"I was saying ..." said the King. "What was I
saying?" And he stretched out his arms and yawned. "I
crave your pardon, my lords. I do believe I've been asleep.
Heigho! but my joints are stiff."</p>

<p>"It was but an after-dinner nap," said the Prime Minister.
"Your Majesty is overspent with the hard hunting yesterday.
Is it your Majesty's will that we should proceed with
our business, or shall the Council rise until to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Go on, my lords, go on," cried the King heartily.
"My little nap has wonderfully refreshed me. What say
you, shall we pass that bill we were discussing a few
minutes ago?"</p>

<p>But at this moment a page came into the room with a
message from the Queen, and as soon as he received it the
King left his seat in the council chamber and went to her.</p>

<p>Alone, among all the people in the castle, the Queen had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
realised immediately she awoke from her charmed sleep,
exactly what had happened. She remembered the words of
the fairy godmother, and she knew that what she had foretold
had come to pass, and that the sleep from which she
and everybody else in the castle had just awakened had lasted
a hundred years.</p>

<p>Her first thought was of her daughter, the Princess
Briar-Rose. Where was she, and what had happened to
her? If she, too, had merely fallen asleep, all was well, but
suppose the doom first spoken by the thirteenth fairy had
taken effect?</p>

<p>In a few words she told the King all that was in her
mind, and without delay messengers were sent all over the
castle to look for the Princess.</p>

<p>In the meantime Briar-Rose and the young Prince were
talking together in the ruined tower. For the first time she
heard the story of the enchantment, and her eyes grew
round with wonder as she listened to her lover's account of
the strange things that had happened in the castle. When
he told of the great hedge and its cruel thorns, and of the
many young men who died in trying to force their way
through it, her eyes filled with tears.</p>

<p>"How great their courage was," she sighed. "Oh, if
only I could bring them back to life."</p>

<p>But the Prince kissed her tears away, and hastened past
that part of his tale, and presently she was smiling again
and happy, because she understood that everything had
happened as it was bound to happen.</p>

<p>Then the Prince took her hand and raised her from the
couch on which she had slept so long, and they went down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
the winding stair together and came to the battlements,
where they found a score of breathless people who had been
running up and down in search of her.</p>

<p>And how surprised these people were to find her in that
place, accompanied by a young man they had never seen
before! She seemed to have grown more beautiful than
ever during her long sleep, and they were amazed by her
loveliness.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i108.png" width="400" height="182" alt="Dancing" title="Dancing" />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>And how may we describe the joy of the King and
Queen when they saw their daughter again and knew that
the good fairy had kept her word? The King was so
delighted that all he could say was "Bless my soul! bless
my soul!" And the Queen could say nothing at all, for
she was weeping for joy.</p>

<p>What a feast there was that night! In spite of the
hundred years that had gone by it was still the Princess's
birthday, and she was in reality no more than fifteen years
old, for time had stood still for her. So she had her birthday
feast just the same, and it was her betrothal feast too,
for the King joined the hands of the young Prince and his
daughter and gave them his blessing.</p>
